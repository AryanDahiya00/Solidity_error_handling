# Solidity Error Handling

Welcome to the Error Handling in Solidity project! This repository serves as an introductory guide to understanding and implementing error handling in Solidity smart contracts. Whether you're a newcomer to Solidity or looking to reinforce your knowledge, this project is designed to provide a solid foundation.

## What is Error Handling in Solidity?

Error handling is a critical aspect of writing secure and robust smart contracts. Solidity offers several mechanisms for error handling, primarily through the use of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements.

### `require` Statement

- Used to ensure specific conditions for a function to proceed.
- If the condition inside `require` evaluates to false, the function reverts, and any state changes are rolled back.

### `assert` Statement

- Utilized for internal error checking.
- If the condition inside `assert` evaluates to false, it signals a bug in the contract, and the transaction is reverted.
- Typically used to check for conditions that should never occur under normal circumstances.

### `revert` Statement

- Reverts the transaction with a custom error message.
- Allows explicit handling of specific cases where you want to reject the transaction and provide a reason.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. If you don't have an account, visit [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to get started.

### Execution

1. Create a new file in Remix (e.g., `ErrorHandlingContract.sol`).
2. Copy and paste the provided code.

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

contract ErrorHandlingContract {
    uint public value;

    function setValue(uint _value) public {
        require(_value > 0, "Value must be greater than 0.");
        assert(_value != value);
        value = _value;
    }

    function performDivision(uint _numerator, uint _denominator) public pure returns (uint) {
        require(_denominator != 0, "Cannot divide by zero.");
        if (_numerator % _denominator != 0) {
            revert("Numerator must be divisible by denominator.");
        }
        return _numerator / _denominator;
    }
}

```

3. Compile the code using the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
4. Deploy the contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

Feel free to explore the provided Solidity code and experiment with error handling functionalities.
